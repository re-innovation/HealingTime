Code and some design files for motor controller boards

# Overview
The main project is an array of stepper motors (20 in total in a bank 4 wide and 5 high, measuring around 1.5m (w) x 2m (h)).
These motors spin 360 degrees after a set time delay (typically every 15 mins). The spin takes a set amount of time (typically 30 seconds). They must reset to the same point afetr each spin.
